Introductory lesson for html

1. Design your web page on paper

2. Open up Notepad, Atom, or your favorite text editor

3. Create a simple HTML Document with the following code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
  
<a href="https://www.kewforest.org">This is a link</a>

</body>
</html>
```

4. Save your page as "index.html"

5. Open it in a browser

6. Now, use the ```<h1>``` and ```<p>``` tags to layout your webpage - don't worry if it doesn't look like your design, just get all the content in. We'll format it later.
