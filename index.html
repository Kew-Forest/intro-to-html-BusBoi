    <h1>Global Warming</h1>

    <h2>What is Global Warming?</h2>
    <p> The dictionary definition of Global Warming is "A gradual increase in the overall temperature of the earth's atmosphere generally attributed to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and other pollutants". This means that the Earth warms up since extra carbon dioxide and too much polution enters the Earth's atmosphere.</p>

    <h2>Why is it happening?</h2>
    <p>Global Warming is caused by the Greenhouse Effect. The Greenhouse Effect is when the sun shines onto the Earth
      and greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat and reflect it. This combined with the rest of the heat causes the Earth
      to gradually heat up. However, with too many greenhouse gases, the Earth starts to heat up too much. The greenhouse gases
      are water vapor, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and methane. The amount of greenhouse gases increases because of the burning
      of fossil fuels. <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/">Link to source</a></p>

      <h2>Results of Global Warming</h2>
      <p>Global Warming causes:
        <ul>-Shrinking ice caps and glaciers</ul>
        <ul>-rising sea levels</ul>
        <ul>-more intense heat waves</ul>
        <ul>-heat waves and droughts more often</ul>
        <ul>-rising temperatures affecting plant flowering</ul>
        <ul>-stronger hurricanes</ul>
        <ul>-different rain patterns</ul>
